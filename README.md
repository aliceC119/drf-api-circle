# The drf-api-circle

## Advanced Front-End Portfolia Project(PP5) 

The drf-api-circle is the backend for the Circle application, developed using the Django Rest Framework (DRF). It serves as the foundation for a social network (Circle) dedicated to sharing ideas about classical music, specifically designed for classical music enthusiasts.

The drf-api-circle is designed for users to share their favourite musicians through pictures and videos. Users can like, comment on and copy posts or videos, which encourages communication within the platform. To enhance the user experience, the backend application also includes a follow function that allows users to follow or unfollow each other. 

This API is built to integrate smoothly with a React frontend, ensuring a seamless experience for users who want to connect and engage with each other.
